		\begin{itemize}
			\item In 1953, Watson, Crick, Wilkins, Franklin, and Gosling were the first to describe the structure of DNA \newline
			\item They discovered the \textcolor{blue}{right-handed double helix} (canonical B-form DNA), the most common form found in cells \newline
		\end{itemize}

	%Also called synthetic sick because it can lead to reduced cell viability as opposed to death
	\begin{frame}{DNA Can Adopt Alternative Structures}
		\label{link1}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Now, more than 15 types of DNA structure that differ from the canonical B-form have been reported (non-canonical or non-B form DNA) \newline
			\item Through sequencing of the human genome, we now know over half the genome is composed of repetitive elements - these were initially thought to be `junk DNA' \newline
			
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=9cm, height=1.2cm]{repeats.png}
			\end{center}
			 
			\item A crucial feature of some repetitive sequences is their ability to fold into non-canonical DNA structures (non-B DNA)

	% Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) repair DNA SSBs through the BER pathway. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, prevent repair by trapping the inactivated PARP onto the SSB, resulting in the generation of DNA DSBs during the replication process. In tumors with a homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), such as a BRCA1/2 mutation, the low-fidelity repair mechanism of NHEJ leads to increasing genetic instability and ultimately death of the tumor cell.
	\begin{frame}{Non-Canonical DNA Structures are Involved in Biological Processes}
		
		Non-B DNA structures have been shown to co-localize with \textcolor{blue}{functional genomic loci} (promoters, enhancers, etc) and \textcolor{blue}{genetic instability hotspots} \newline
		
		This suggests a role for non-B DNA in vital cellular events such as;
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Regulation of transcription
			\item Regulation of DNA replication and recombination
			\item Regulating genome integrity
		\end{itemize}

	\textbf{\color{blue}Repeat Expansion Diseases:} Expansions of non-B DNA structure-forming repeats have been implicated in many neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. \newline
	
	\textbf{\color{blue}Genetic Instability Diseases:} Non-canonical DNA structures are associated with increased mutability (point mutations, deletions, insertions and chromosomal translocations)
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Enriched at chromosomal breakpoints in translocation-related cancers such as lymphomas and leukaemias.
		\item Can be recognized by DNA repair proteins, triggering error-generating repair processes
		\item G-quadruplexes are present within most human oncogenic promoters and at telomeres - a current theraputic target to downregulate transcription or block telomere elongation in cancer cells.

		Human sex differences are mainly caused by;
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Gonadal hormone secretions
			\item Genes located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y) \newline
		\end{enumerate}
	This leads to differences in the frequency of certain cancer types and the efficacy of treatments in males and females
